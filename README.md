# Skeleton adapter for AskDelphi

This is an empty framework that can be used to implement a content Adapter for AskDelphi

What's needed is that a module is built that wraps access to the actual data.

Then on top of that module, IResourceRepository and ITopicRepository implemenattions can be built that actually serve content according to the adapter rules.
